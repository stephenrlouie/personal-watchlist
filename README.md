# personal-watchlist
Tools, technology that I want to keep my eye on or get great use out of. A library of articles/podcasts/etc that I've shared myself or have received and really appreciated.

I'll try to keep this up to date and organize it for others and myself to digest. My hope is to keep these lists from getting too long and relevant. Hopefully this is a glimpse into what I find interesting, think is upcoming, or just generally useful.

These lists tend to avoid things that have become common place like kubernetes, argo, cert-manager, etc.

*I've been keeping this list for myself since ~2018, but figured it would be more useful to share*
