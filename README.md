# personal-watchlist
Tools, technology and articles that I want to keep my eye on. Usually stuff I've shared with others or have received and really appreciated. My hope is to keep these lists from getting too long and remain relevant over time. Hopefully this is a glimpse into what I find interesting, think is upcoming, or just generally useful. My curation process is some combination of newsletters, RSS feeds, lurking channels in hangops or stuff I receive from folks in my network.

I've been keeping this list for myself since ~2018, but figured it would be more useful to share.

These lists will tend to avoid things I find obvious like listing 'containers' as something to keep track of. I know I've done a poor job of purging outdated links, or keeping up with projects that have new names or possibly more modern replacements.
