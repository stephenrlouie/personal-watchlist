# personal-watchlist
Tools, technology that I want to keep my eye on or get great use out of. A dump of articles/etc that I've shared my self or have received that I thought was enlightening or voiced something I believe in a more eloquent way than I could come up with.

I'll try to keep this up to date and organize it for others and myself to digest. My hope is to keep these lists from getting too long but should be a good glimpse into what I find interesting, think is upcoming, or just generally useful.

*I've been keeping this list for myself since ~2018, but figured it would be more useful to share*
