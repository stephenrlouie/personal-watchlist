| kubie               | kubie is an alternative to kubectx, kubens and the k on prompt modification script. It offers context switching, namespace switching and prompt modification in a way that makes each shell independent from others.

You can configure the paths where kubie will look for contexts.                                                                                                            | [kubie](https://github.com/sbstp/kubie)                   |
