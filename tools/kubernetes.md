| docker bake                     | BuildKit efficiently handles multiple concurrent build requests and de-duplicating work. The build commands can be combined with general-purpose command runners (for example, make). However, these tools generally invoke builds in sequence and therefore cannot leverage the full potential of BuildKit parallelization, or combine BuildKit’s output for the user. | [docker bake](https://docs.docker.com/build/customize/bake/)                                 |
